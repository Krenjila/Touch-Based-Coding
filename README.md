# Touch-Based Coding Prototype

This project is a research prototype of a gesture-driven coding environment , inspired by Scratch but designed for intuitive, touch-based program creation.

# Features
- Touch-based coding with HTML/JS prototypes
- Multiple iterations (`Prototype_1.html`, `Prototype_2.html`)
- Figma-based design exploration and user testing

# Files
- `Code_Prototype_1.js` — First JavaScript prototype
- `Code_Prototype_2.js` — Second iteration
- `Prototype_1.html` — HTML demo for prototype 1
- `Prototype_2.html` — HTML demo for prototype 2
- `README_Prototype_1.md`, `README_Prototype_2.md` — Notes for each iteration

# How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Krenjila/Touch-Based-Coding.git
   cd Touch-Based-Coding
